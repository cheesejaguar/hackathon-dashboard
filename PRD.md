# GitHub Repository Dashboard

A real-time monitoring dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into GitHub repository activity including commit flow, branch management, pull request tracking, and CI/CD status monitoring.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Real-time** - Live updates create a sense of immediacy and connection to development activity
2. **Comprehensive** - All essential repository metrics available in one unified view without context switching
3. **Intuitive** - Information hierarchy guides users naturally from overview to details

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
Multiple interconnected features with repository state management, API integration, and real-time updates while maintaining focused simplicity.

## Essential Features

**Repository Selection**
- Functionality: Input field to specify GitHub repository (owner/repo format) with validation
- Purpose: Allows users to monitor any public repository they're interested in
- Trigger: User enters repository name and clicks connect/monitor button
- Progression: Input validation → API connection → Dashboard population → Live monitoring
- Success criteria: Valid repository loads with initial data displayed within 3 seconds

**Live Commit Flow**
- Functionality: Real-time stream of recent commits with author, message, timestamp, and branch
- Purpose: Track development velocity and understand recent changes at a glance
- Trigger: Automatic refresh every 30 seconds after repository connection
- Progression: API fetch → Data processing → Timeline visualization → Auto-refresh cycle
- Success criteria: Shows last 20 commits with accurate timestamps and updating indicators

**Active Branch Monitoring**
- Functionality: List of all repository branches with last commit info and activity indicators
- Purpose: Understand branch strategy and identify active development areas
- Trigger: Loads with repository data and refreshes with commit flow
- Progression: Branch fetch → Activity analysis → Visual organization → Status updates
- Success criteria: All branches displayed with accurate last activity and ahead/behind main metrics

**Pull Request Dashboard**
- Functionality: Open PRs with status, reviews, checks, and merge readiness indicators
- Purpose: Track code review process and deployment readiness
- Trigger: Auto-loads with repository and updates on PR activity
- Progression: PR fetch → Status analysis → Review aggregation → Actionability scoring
- Success criteria: Shows all open PRs with clear status indicators and review progress

**CI/CD Status Monitor**
- Functionality: Live GitHub Actions status with workflow names, run times, and success rates
- Purpose: Monitor deployment pipeline health and catch failures quickly
- Trigger: Fetches on repository load and updates on workflow completion
- Progression: Workflow fetch → Status aggregation → Performance analysis → Alert highlighting
- Success criteria: Current workflow status visible with historical success trends

## Edge Case Handling

- **Invalid Repository**: Clear error message with suggested format and public repository requirement
- **API Rate Limits**: Graceful degradation with refresh interval adjustment and user notification
- **Network Failures**: Offline indicator with automatic retry logic and cached data display
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance for repositories with no recent activity or missing features
- **Large Repositories**: Pagination and filtering to handle repos with hundreds of branches/PRs

## Design Direction

The design should feel like a professional developer tool - clean, data-dense, and purposeful with subtle real-time indicators that create engagement without distraction. Rich interface with multiple information panels that can be scanned quickly.

## Color Selection

Triadic (three equally spaced colors) - Using deep blue, warm orange, and sage green to create a technical yet approachable palette that clearly communicates different types of information.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Communicates reliability and technical professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: Charcoal Gray (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) for backgrounds and Soft Gray (oklch(0.85 0.01 240)) for cards
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 45)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for active states and important alerts
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Soft White oklch(0.98 0.005 240)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.15 0.02 240)) - Ratio 11.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Soft Gray oklch(0.95 0.01 240)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.15 0.02 240)) - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(0.98 0.005 240)) - Ratio 7.4:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Charcoal oklch(0.25 0.02 240)): White text (oklch(0.98 0.005 240)) - Ratio 14.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange oklch(0.65 0.15 45)): White text (oklch(0.98 0.005 240)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Clean, technical typography that emphasizes readability and hierarchy while maintaining developer tool aesthetics using Inter for its excellent screen legibility and code-friendly characteristics.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Dashboard Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (General Content): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed spacing
  - Small (Timestamps/Meta): Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing
  - Code (Commit Hashes): JetBrains Mono/14px/normal spacing

## Animations

Subtle functionality with moments of delight that reinforce the live nature of the data - real-time pulse indicators and smooth transitions create engagement without overwhelming the technical content.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Gentle pulse animations on real-time indicators communicate "live" status, smooth data transitions maintain context during updates
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Live status indicators (subtle pulse) > Data refreshes (fade transitions) > User interactions (quick responses) > Background updates (nearly invisible)

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Card for each major section, Badge for status indicators, Button for actions, Input for repository selection, Separator for visual organization, ScrollArea for long lists, Progress for loading states
- **Customizations**: Live status indicator component, Repository input with validation, Commit timeline component, Branch status cards, PR review progress indicators
- **States**: All interactive elements need hover, active, and loading states with loading skeletons for data fetch periods
- **Icon Selection**: GitBranch, GitCommit, GitPullRequest, Play/Pause for CI status, Clock for timestamps, Users for collaborators, CheckCircle/XCircle for status
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4/6/8/12px padding using Tailwind's spacing scale with 6px as base unit for tight information density
- **Mobile**: Single column layout with collapsible sections, horizontal scroll for commit timeline, bottom sheet for detailed views, priority-based progressive disclosure
