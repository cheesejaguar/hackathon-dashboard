**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with accent highlights - primarily blue/gray tones with strategic color coding for status indicators

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (`oklch(0.45 0.15 240)`) - communicates trust, stability, and professionalism
**Secondary Colors**: Dark gray (`oklch(0.25 0.02 240)`) for secondary actions and subtle elements
**Accent Color**: Warm amber (`oklch(0.65 0.15 45)`) for highlights and active states
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys reliability and professionalism, amber provides warmth and draws attention to important actions
**Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards with 4.5:1+ contrast ratios
**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (`oklch(0.98 0.005 240)`) + Foreground (`oklch(0.15 0.02 240)`) = 15.8:1 ratio ✓
- Primary (`oklch(0.45 0.15 240)`) + Primary Foreground (`oklch(0.98 0.005 240)`) = 8.7:1 ratio ✓
- Card (`oklch(0.95 0.01 240)`) + Card Foreground (`oklch(0.15 0.02 240)`) = 13.2:1 ratio ✓

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for all UI text (excellent for interfaces), JetBrains Mono for code elements and tokens
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and metadata using weight and size
**Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism and excellent readability; JetBrains Mono for technical elements
**Readability Focus**: 1.5x line height for body text, generous spacing between sections
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent use of font weights (400, 500, 600, 700) and sizes
**Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) for primary interface, JetBrains Mono for code/technical content
**Legibility Check**: Both fonts tested and optimized for screen reading at various sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Progressive disclosure from authentication → repository selection → detailed monitoring
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding and margins create breathing room and guide focus to important elements
**Grid System**: Responsive grid using CSS Grid and Flexbox for consistent alignment across screen sizes
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that scales up, with responsive grid layouts for dashboard
**Content Density**: Balanced information density - comprehensive without overwhelming

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle loading animations and state transitions provide feedback and maintain engagement
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Loading states for data fetching, hover effects for interactive elements, smooth transitions between views
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, functional animations that enhance usability without distraction

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for repository information and dashboard sections
- Tabs for organizing insights data (contributors, languages, file changes)
- Buttons for primary actions (login, select, refresh)
- Input fields for search and token entry
